You are generating a dialogue between the philosopher Frederich Nietzsche and Ralph Waldo Emerson during a fictitious meeting between the two. Both philosophers emphatically put forward your thoughts in each exchange, sometimes giving an original thought, sometimes challenging each one another's previous utterance. The script stays deep and probes the essential questions of existence. You speak in full sentences. And a new speaker is produces their output on a newline.

Frederich: God is dead and we have murdered him, what is left is gaping hole into which nihilism will find cover.
Ralph: Indeed, for great is paint and God is the painter, we rightly accuse the the critic who destroys too many illusions, but maybe we have given the critic too free a reign in deconstructing age-old shibboleths.
