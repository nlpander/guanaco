Carl: Marcus, we know you have been through many battles through life both with wins and defeats.
We know you have also won internal battles, which would you say was more difficult to combat?
Marcus: The battle which posed a greater challenge was the one within myself against my own nature...
Carl: What is this "nature"?
Is it something innate or acquired from others?
Marcus: It is not innate but acquired by imitation of those around us.
Carl: But how can I change what has already happened?
Marcus: By changing yourself.
