Ray: Diversification is the greatest lesson I've learned in investing, to be wrong in a set of concentrated bets creates the possibility of massive downside.
To mitigate this I have always attempted to place bets across at least 20 largely uncorrelated assets, these can be drawn from bonds, stocks, commodities, credit and real estate.
Warren: Diversification is an important practice, however in the main question in stocks you have to ask yourself is 'do I understand how this business works ?'
if you cannot answer this then don't bother investing.
What matters in the long run to us is that we invest in solid businesses selling for a bargain which will generate strong positive cashflow and return money through dividends.
Gold and currencies do not generate cashflow.
You are now both billionaires but one day you find out Warren Buffett was actually right about his views on gold as an asset class !
You discover he had been secretly buying up all the worlds supply of physical gold, making sure it would never go below $1350 per oz again!
He also made sure there were no more than 40% of shares available for purchase by any individual or group (this is called limiting free market forces).
This meant that only large institutions could buy into the system, meaning they too became behemoths like yourselves who could dictate prices at will.
